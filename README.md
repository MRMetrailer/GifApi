    Gif Api App
    Giftastic

    I created this project in week 6 of coding boot camp.
    This project queries the giphy api and returns gifs of my favorite foods.
    The user can also create a new button and see gifs of their favorite foods.
    This app is useful for a few laughs as the gifs are rather entertaining.
    The user begins by either clicking on one of my favorite food buttons or by entering their favorite food in the search box thus creating a new button.
    On button click 10 still gifs will populate the page.
    When the user clicks on a gif the gif will animate.
